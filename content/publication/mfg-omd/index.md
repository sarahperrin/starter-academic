abstract: "We address scaling up equilibrium computation
in Mean Field Games (MFGs) using Online Mirror Descent (OMD). We show that continuoustime OMD provably converges to a Nash equilibrium under a natural and well-motivated set
of monotonicity assumptions. This theoretical
result nicely extends to multi-population games
and to settings involving common noise. A thorough experimental investigation on various single and multi-population MFGs shows that OMD
outperforms traditional algorithms such as Fictitious Play (FP). We empirically show that OMD
scales up and converges significantly faster than
FP by solving, for the first time to our knowledge, examples of MFGs with hundreds of billions states. This study establishes the state-ofthe-art for learning in large-scale multi-agent and
multi-population games."
