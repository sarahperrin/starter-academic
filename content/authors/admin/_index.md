I am a PhD student at Inria Lille, under the supervision of Pr. Olivier Pietquin (Google Brain) and Pr. Romuald Élie (DeepMind). Before starting my PhD, I graduated from École Polytechnique.

My research focuses on applying Reinforcement Learning to solve Mean Field Games. Mean Field Games theory studies decision making in a population of an infinite number of identical agents. It has inspired numerous applications such as population dynamics modeling, crowd motion, economics or energy management and production.

In my spare time, I like to play and compose electronic music. I also enjoy outdoor activities, especially skiing and surfing.
